# Rusty Sapper
A simple minesweeper game written in Rust programming language.

### How to play
The objective is to clear a filed containing hidden mines without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each cell. The first discovered cell will never have a mine. It will clear the filed and place numbers on neighboring cells. The numbers reflect the number of mines touching a square.

- Use the arrow keys to move around the field
- Press `M` to mark a cell
- Press `Space` to discover a cell
- Press `Escape` to switch between the game and menu
